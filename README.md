# Chromecast Background Downloading Script

This repo downloads a bunch of images used for Chromecast's background. It downloads it to ~/Pictures. To change that, you need to update the path in `index.js`.

To run, simply clone this repo, run `yarn` then `yarn run download`. That's it.


### Note for Ubuntu

If you want a rotating background, on 18.04+ just use Shotwell. It's installed by default.
